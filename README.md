Over the course of a semester, I will self learn JavaScript.

**The History of JavaScript**
====================================
Javacript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. He is most famous as a co-founder of Mozilla which is the company that created the popular Firefox web browser.When he worked for  Netscape in 1995, they were looking to add interactivity into webpages for NetScape2 and thats when JavaScript was invented. Javascript added many new features to web pages like buttons, forms and menus. While JavaScript is primarily used for web development, it can also be used for desktop applications, mobile applications, and server-side programming. Many browser based games are also created with Javascript. Some examples of projects that have been built using JavaScript include:


+ Google Chrome
+ Netflix
+ Twitter
+ Amazon
+ Uber


My primary resource to learn JavaScript will be the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation. It has many  resource on like articles and tutorials. W3schools is also a great reference with many examples. I will also reference books like Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke and Javascript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan. 


**Getting Started in JavaScript**
====================================
To install JavaScript, you can either download the Node.js which is a Javascript runtime, or use a web-based IDE like CodePen. Javascript code can be viewed in the Developer tools in a web browser. There is no one "recommended" programming environment for JavaScript. However, some popular environments include Node.js, Visual Studio Code, and Sublime Text. To run a program in JavaScript, you can either use a command-line interpreter like Node.js, or use a web-based IDE. Comments are often used to add more information about the code and it is ignored by the interpretor. To write comments in JavaScript, you type to forward slashes followed by whatever you want in the comment. Here is an example of a comment:
