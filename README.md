# CS330-Programing-Language-Project
Over the course of a semester, I will self learn JavaScript.

**The History of JavaScript**
====================================
JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. He is most famous as a co-founder of Mozilla, the company that created the popular Firefox web browser. When he worked for Netscape in 1995, they were looking to add interactivity to web pages for Netscape 2, a web browser, and that's when JavaScript was invented. JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language. It added many new features to web pages, such as buttons, animations, and fancy menus. While JavaScript is primarily used for web development, it can also be used for desktop applications, mobile applications, and server-side programming. Many browser-based games are also created with JavaScript. Some examples of projects that have been built using JavaScript include:


+ Google Chrome
+ Netflix
+ Twitter
+ Amazon
+ Uber


My primary resource to learn JavaScript will be the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation. It has many resources like articles and tutorials. W3schools is also a great reference with many examples. I will also reference books like "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke and "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan. 


**Getting Started in JavaScript**
====================================
Since JavaScript is the language of the web, you can actually open the developer tools in most web browsers to start programming in JavaScript. Additionally, you can create an HTML file that has a <script> tag containing JavaScript. If you open the HTML in a web browser, the JavaScript code can be interpreted and executed. You can also use Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a browser. After downloading Node.js, you can type commands into a terminal to run JavaScript code. There are also special web-based IDEs like CodePen that allow you to execute JavaScript code.
  
There is no one "recommended" programming environment for JavaScript since there are so many ways to run it. For this project, my focus will be on using the Visual Studio Code IDE to write the code and using Node.js and a web browser to run the code.

**Comments in JavaScript**
 ====================================
Comments are often used to add more information about the code and it is ignored by the interpretor. To write single line comments in JavaScript, you type to forward slashes followed by whatever you want in the comment. Here is an example of a comment:

  // This is a comment
  
 To write multi-line comments you would start the comment with /* and end with */. Here is an example of a multi-line comment:
  
  /* this is
  
  a multi-line comment */*
