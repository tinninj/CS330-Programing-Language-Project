# CS330-Programing-Language-Project
Over the course of a semester I'll self learn a programing language of my choice.  

**#The History of JavaScript**
Javacript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. He is most famous as a co-founder of Mozilla which is the company that created the popular Firefox browser.  He was working for Netscape at the time where they were looking to add interactivity into webpages. JavaScript was originally called LiveScript, but it was renamed JavaScript before it was released. Javascript added many new features to web pages like buttons, forms and menus. While JavaScript is primarily used for web development, it can also be used for desktop applications, mobile applications, and server-side programming. Many browser based games are also created with Javascript. Some examples of projects that have been built using JavaScript include:
-Google Chrome browser and the games built into it
-Netflix
-Twitter
-Amazon
-Uber
My primary resource will be the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation. It has many  resource on JavaScript like articles and tutorials. W3schools is also a great reference with many examples.  I will also reference books like Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke and Javascript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan.
